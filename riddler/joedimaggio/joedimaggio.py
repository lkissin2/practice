# SOLUTION TO 2019_05_10 RIDDLER CLASSIC
# Five brothers join the Riddler Baseball Independent Society, or RBIs. Each of
# them enjoys a lengthy career of 20 seasons, with 160 games per season and four
# plate appearances per game. (To make this simple, assume each plate appearance
# results in a hit or an out, so there are no sac flies or walks to complicate
# this math.)
# Given that their batting averages are .200, .250, .300, .350 and .400, what
# are each brother’s chances of beating DiMaggio’s 56-game hitting streak at
# some point in his career? (Streaks can span across seasons.)
# By the way, their cousin has a .500 average, but he will get tossed from the
# league after his 10th season when he tests positive for performance enhancers.
# What are his chances of beating the streak?
