# Riddler Express:
	# From Freddie Simmons, a guessing game:
	# Take a standard deck of cards, and pull out the numbered cards from one suit (the cards 2 through 10). Shuffle them, and then lay them face down in a row. Flip over the first card. Now guess whether the next card in the row is bigger or smaller. If you’re right, keep going.
	# If you play this game optimally, what’s the probability that you can get to the end without making any mistakes?
	# Extra credit: What if there were more cards — 2 through 20, or 2 through 100? How do your chances of getting to the end change?
	# pseudocode:
	# make list 2 thru 10
	# randomize list
	# define expectation_value as mean(cards)
	# if card > expectation_value, guess cards[n+1] is less
	# else guess higher
	# if correct, repeat loop
	# if incorrect record as loss, update win rate
	# repeat 10k times or until win rate converges
